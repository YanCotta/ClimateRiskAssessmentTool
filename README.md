# Climate Risk Assessment Tool
A prototype system applying machine learning to local meteorological and topographical data for climate risk prediction. This repository showcases the intersection of biological insights, climate science, and AI/ML techniques.

## Features
- Real-time weather data integration
- Flood, heatwave, and hurricane risk assessment
- Scalable architecture for other climate risks
- Data visualization for quick result interpretation
- Biological and ecological considerations for adaptive strategies

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Packages listed in `requirements.txt`

## Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```markdown

## Future Improvements
- Enhanced machine learning model training with historical climate and ecological data
- Expanded data acquisition for heat-stress biology
- More detailed flood modeling using region-specific features
